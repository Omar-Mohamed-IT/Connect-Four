# Connect-4 Game

This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic **Connect-4** game. One of my very first projects. I created the game in C++ first and then converted it into JavaScript code. 
The game allows two players to take turns dropping chips into columns, with the goal of being the first to connect four chips in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features

- Two-player mode.
- Visual representation of player moves using images for chips.
- Column-based selection for chip insertion.
- The game checks for winning conditions (4 in a row) and declares the winner.
- The board automatically resets with the "Reset" button.

## How to Play

1. Players take turns by clicking on the column they want to drop their chip into.
2. Chips will automatically fall to the lowest available row in the selected column.
3. The game declares a winner if one player gets four chips in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
4. Use the "Reset" button to start a new game.

## Future Enhancements

This project is **currently under development** and will be enhanced with the following features in future updates:

- **AI Opponent**: Allowing single-player mode with AI as the second player.
- **Improved UI**: Enhancing the visuals with better styling and animations.
- **Scoreboard**: Displaying scores of multiple rounds.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Making the game more responsive on mobile devices.
- **Bug Fixes**: Address known bugs and improve overall stability.

## Current Status

The project is a **work in progress**, and there may be some minor bugs or unimplemented features. Further updates will improve the game logic, user experience, and design.

Stay tuned for future updates!
